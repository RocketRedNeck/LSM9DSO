*9 Degrees of Freedom LSM9DS0 IMU *](http://www.drotek.fr/shop/fr/home/677-imu-9dof-lsm9ds0-stmicroelectronics.html)

The 9DOF LSM9DS0 IMU incorporates three sensors: a triple-axis gyro, a triple-axis accelerometer, and a triple-axis magnetometer - 
to give you nine degrees of inertial measurement. 
The outputs of all sensors are available over an I2C or SPI interface you can choose which is best for you. 
The LSM9DS0 IMU can be used as a very powerful control mechanism for UAVs, 
autonomous vehicles and image stabilization systems or any other system, the only limit is your imagination.
